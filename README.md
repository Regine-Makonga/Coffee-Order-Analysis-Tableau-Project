## Analysis Results
By analyzing the results obtained from our dashboard, we observed:
 - Low coffee sales in 2020 with 0.6% less sales than 2019 (-0.6% YoY), relatively stable sales in 2021 with 13.6% more sales than 2021 (+13.6% YoY) but a significant decrease in sales in 2022 with -48.7% then 2021 (-48.7% YoY). The negative growth can indicates potential market saturation or reduced customer engagement.
 - The top 10 customers for a significant portion of sales, which could indicate dependence on key customers. Retention and satisfaction of these customers are critical.
 - Excelsa and Liberica coffee types are driving revenue. Robusta is underperforming in both sales and roast type preferences.
 - Dark roasts coffee are significantly more popular than light roasts coffee and medium roast coffee.
 - Sales are heavily concentrated in the U.S.
 - Sales are consistent over months without any evident spikes, suggesting no clear seasonal or promotional sales boosts.
## Recommendations
 - Focus on loyalty programs for the top 10 customers to retain their contribution to sales. Identify potential customers with similar profiles to the top 10 and target them with marketing campaigns.
 - Investigate why there were low sales in 2020 and 2022 than in 2019 and 2021.
 - Investigate why Robusta is underperforming. Consider improving its quality, changing its pricing strategy, or promoting it through bundled offers with popular products like Excelsa and Liberica.
 - Develop more variations in dark roasts since they are the most popular.
 - Explore untapped markets by analyzing potential demand in countries with similar coffee preferences.
 - Launch seasonal promotions or discounts to create sales spikes during specific periods.
 - Introduce campaigns highlighting the uniqueness of Excelsa and Liberica.
 - Collect customer feedback on the existing product range and services to improve overall satisfaction and identify areas for innovation.
