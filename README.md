By analyzing the results obtained from our dashboard, we observed:
 - Low coffee sales in 2020 with 0.6% less sales than 2019 (-0.6% YoY), relatively stable sales in 2021 with 13.6% more sales than 2021 (+13.6% YoY) but a significant decrease in sales in 2022 with -48.7% then 2021 (-48.7% YoY). The negative growth can indicates potential market saturation or reduced customer engagement.
 - The top 10 customers for a significant portion of sales, which could indicate dependence on key customers. Retention and satisfaction of these customers are critical.
